00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,520
OK, so in this project, we're going to work a little bit with the HTML5 audio tag and we're going

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,550
to create this sound board so we have these different effects.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,140
We just give you a sample.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,370
Hopefully you can hear that, so basically we click a button, it makes a sound effect, and if the

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,420
sound is still playing and we click another one, it's going to stop that effect and start the next

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,720
one.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,720
So we can do this by using audio tags.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,420
So an additional five, you have the audio tag, you can show controls.

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,360
We're not going to do that.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,140
We're going to do everything through JavaScript.

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:47,630
So basically, if you capture an audio element with, you know, get element by idea, whatever, you

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:56,520
have some methods and properties on that object that you bring in, such as play, pause and so on.

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,180
So this is the Amdocs.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,890
If you want to take a look at that and see the different methods, what we're doing is pretty simple,

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,860
but I think it's a nice addition to the course working with the audio element.

16
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,450
So let's go ahead and get into it.
