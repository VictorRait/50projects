00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,390
So this is a cool little project for picking random choices now we have this text area, and as soon

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,870
as I start to type, like I'll say choice one and you'll see it'll format down here is like a tag.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,860
And to create another choice, I just need to put a comma and start to type again, say choice to another

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,370
comma.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,250
Choice three, choice four.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,530
Obviously I can do as many as I want and then as soon as I hit enter, it's going to give us this cool

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,560
little effect and it's going to stop on a random choice.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,340
It's also going to clear the text area.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,170
All right.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:41,580
So if you just need if you need some little helper to help you make a choice between however many items,

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,130
however many objects, I mean, you could do numbers here.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,750
And it's just going to stop on a random one.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,460
OK, so that's what will be creating let's go ahead and get started.
