1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,950
All right, let's get started on a random choice pick, so I have my project starter here, I'm going

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,020
to go ahead and just change the title here to Random Choice Picker.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,480
And let's go down here.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,630
So we're going to have a container.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,830
We can get rid of the H1.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:25,110
Let's put a class of container here and inside the container will have an H3 and let's say enter all

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,710
of.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:35,850
Enter all of the choices divided by a comma.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:45,360
Go ahead and just specify what a comma is, Floren and then let's do a line break here and then we'll

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,110
say, press enter when you are done.

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,170
All right.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,590
So under the H three, let's put a text area.

13
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:07,480
And this is going to have an I.D., we'll call text area real creative and let's have we don't need

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,000
this stuff here because we're going to style of a success and then we don't need a name.

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,430
I do want a placeholder, though.

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,170
So it's a placeholder.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,000
And we'll go ahead and set that to enter choices here.

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,850
Dot, dot, dot.

19
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,320
Now, under the text area, we're going to have an area for the tags, so we'll give this an idea of

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:41,650
tags and the these are going to be span's with the class of tag and obviously with some text of the

21
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,430
different choices.

22
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,800
But this is going to get inserted with the JavaScript.

23
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,780
However, for now, I'm just going to hardcoded just so we can see it in style it.

24
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,930
So we'll just create a tag here.

25
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,300
It's a choice one.

26
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,510
We'll just add three of these civil two to three and save.

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:09,150
OK, so that should do it for the HTML is jump into our success and let's so font family will just keep

28
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,610
our bottle.

29
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,520
That's violence at a background color.

30
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:22,770
Background color is going to be hexadecimal value to be eight eight F zero, which is a blue color,

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:30,420
and we have display Flex and Flex Direction columns center.

32
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,600
So all this is fine.

33
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,360
So now the H3, let's give that a color of white on that blue background.

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,330
And let's also just add a little bit of margin.

35
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,810
We'll do 10 pixels, zero, 20 pixels for the margin.

36
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,880
You know, let's change the font to Molly.

37
00:02:53,130 --> 00:03:03,930
So success questionmark family equals Molly and let's right here in the body and change this.

38
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,810
There we go, so that's a little bit more readable and then for the container.

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:22,190
Also, the a whiff of the container to 500 pixels and actually that should do it, so have 500 pixel

40
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,880
container,

41
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,810
let's do the text area.

42
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:33,680
So that has a class of text area and I want to get rid of the border.

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,210
So say border none.

44
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,620
And let's make this a block level element.

45
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:46,700
So display block and we're going to set the width to 100 percent of its container.

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:57,840
Which is not working, and that's because I gave it an idea of text area, so we'll just sort of style

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,730
the text area.

48
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,030
So just take away that dot.

49
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,900
There's no class.

50
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,000
The height of this is going to be 100 hundred pixels.

51
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:19,020
And let's inherit the family of Molly and then let's add some padding, do 10 pixels padding.

52
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:27,810
And as far as margin goes, we'll do zero zero 20 pixels, and then let's make the font size a little

53
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,460
bigger, 16 pixels.

54
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,790
And then that should be good for the text area.

55
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,640
Now for the tags.

56
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:43,500
So we have span's with the class of tag and we're going to add a background color.

57
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:54,870
So background color is going to be F zero nine three to be it's going to be the background and the color

58
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:05,850
of the text is going to be white and we're going to add a border radius of three pixels and I'm sorry,

59
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,740
not three pixels, 50 pixels.

60
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,450
And patting will do 10 top and bottom, 20 left and right.

61
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:29,020
And let's spread them out a bit so we'll add margin to zero, top five, 10 and zero and the font size,

62
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,220
I'm going to make 14 pixels.

63
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,840
Make that a little smaller.

64
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,470
Let's display as in line block.

65
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:47,650
And yes, that should do it now when it selects, you know, when it selects something at random, it's

66
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,260
going to have a background color.

67
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,980
So we'll have in addition to tag, it will have a class of highlight.

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:05,170
And I just want to change the background color to hexadecimal value, 273, C 75.

69
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:13,420
And just to see what that looks like at, say, the second one here, we add highlights and the highlighted

70
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,470
one will look like that.

71
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,800
OK, so that's it for the user interface here.

72
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,810
So in the next video, we'll go ahead and we'll start to add our JavaScript.
